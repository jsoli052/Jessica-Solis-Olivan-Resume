        <div class="subheading mb-5">Pre-BusinessðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is Jessica Solis Olivan and I was born and raised in Los Angeles California. My parents are both Mexican thus, I grew up with Spanish as my first language and went onto study the language for 3 years in high school and eventually passed the AP Spanish test my senior year. I am currently a freshman at the University of California, Riverside and I am a Pre-business major who is still open to exploring future career options. Aside from Business I became interested in Geology after taking a few courses at UCR. I was on my high school tennis team for three year and continued in my first quarter of college. Although it is still an important hobby of mine, I chose prioritize my classes but in the future I hope to return after the COVID-19 pandemic. Aside from tennis I am also interested in musical theatre, I enjoy dancing, acting, and singing but I have yet to participate in any clubs or activities. This is just a hobby I enjoy during my free time along with watching videos and surfing the web.<br><br>
        Like most students, I gained most of my experiences in high school volunteering and interning at different institutions along with participating in clubs and activities. As I said before I was part of my schoolâ€™s tennis team which has helped me build on my teamwork skills and gain a healthy sense of competition. I was also in my schools Pre-med Club for 3 years and on the last year I joined the board as a treasurer later to become secretary. The club has helped me develop social networking skills because a lot of my responsibilities where to bring speakers to our club meeting for our members to learn about different medical career options. As a board member, I did a lot of public speaking at meetings and I had to learn to communicate with other members of the club aside from the board members to expand my perspectives. I have taken a total of 3 computer classes throughout high school and college enough to say that I am comfortable using office programs such as Word, Excel, and PowerPoint.<br><br> 
        My high school was a medical magnet school so a majority of the opportunities that were available to us where related to the medical health field and where usually associated with hospitals in the area. I specifically interned and volunteered at the Orthopaedic Institute for Children that was right next to my school. I initially became interested in this opportunity because of the Pre-med club and fortunately I was accepted. This was my way of exploring different career paths and when I realized that I wasnâ€™t suited to work in the medical field I continued my volunteer services to expand my experience and further develop future career skills. I gained a larger sense of responsibility because I had office workers, medical experts and patients relying on the responsibilities that I had to complete. Social Networking was a large part of my job too, I had to learn to communicate with everyone I worked with such as the staff, patients, and other students.<br><br>
